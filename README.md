# Joy's Data Analyst Portfolio
## About 
Hello, I'm Joy, a data enthusiast with a passion for transforming raw information into actionable insights. With a background in Biomedical Science and a dedication to harnessing the power of data, I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of data analytics and data science. I currently work as a Data Analyst Intern at an Oil and Gas Consulting Firm. My GitHub portfolio is a reflection of my commitment to continuous learning and my love for data-driven decision-making. It's here that I showcase my projects, which demonstrate my proficiency in programming languages like SQL and Python, along with my ability to clean, model, analyse, and visualise data to derive meaningful, data-backed solutions. Join me on this exploration of data's potential and its role in driving informed business decisions.
